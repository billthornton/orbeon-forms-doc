# Section settings

Each section has:

* a _name_ or identifier, which determines how section data is represented in XML
* XPath expressions that determine the section visibility and readonliness (advanced feature)

![][56]

The section name specifies an identifier for the section, unique in the entire form.

If no section name is explicitly specified, Form Builder assigns a default name, such as "section-1".

The XPath expressions control:

* **Visibility:** whether the section is visible or not.
* **Read-Only:** whether the section is shown as read-only or not.

XPath expressions are described in more details here: [Advanced: XPath expressions in Form Builder][57].
