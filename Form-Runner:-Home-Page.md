[SINCE 2011-07-22 / ORBEON FORMS 4.0]

## Introduction

The Form Runner home page is intended to act as a start page for users accessing forms you deployed in Form Runner, generally created with Form Builder. You access the Form Runner home by adding `fr/` to the path on which you deployed Orbeon Forms. If you deployed Orbeon Forms on `http://www.example.com/orbeon/`, then you can access the From Runner home page at `http://www.example.com/orbeon/fr/`.

## Default view

For each form definition the current user has access to, the following links are shown if allowed:

- Link to the summary page: shown if the current user can perform either one of the read, update, or delete operations on the form. 
- Link to the new page: shown if the current user can perform the create operation on the form.
