## With IntelliJ

This is the recommended way to develop Orbeon Forms, used by the Orbeon developers. We use OS X Mavericks.

### Prerequisites

You need to have already installed:

- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html) 13.1 (previous versions may or may not work)
- [Tomcat 7](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi)

On OS X, you can install git easily if you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install git
```

### Getting the source

If you have never obtained the Orbeon Forms source code, you need to get it [from github](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms). To get the latest code from the `master` branch, run the following command line:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:orbeon/orbeon-forms.git ~/my/projects/orbeon-forms
```

where `~/my/projects` is an existing directory on your system where you want to place the Orbeon Forms source code.

This clones the git repository into a directory called `orbeon-forms`.

*NOTE: There is no guarantee that the master branch is stable, as it contains some of the latest changes to Orbeon Forms!*

### Opening the project

To open Orbeon Forms in IntelliJ:

- Go to the "File" → "Open Project" menu and  select the `orbeon-forms` directory.
- IntelliJ then indexes the project, which can take a minute the first time you do it.

### Building the project

- Go to the "Build" → "Make Project" (this takes about 1 mn 10 seconds on a recent laptop).
- Go to the "Ant Build" pane and run the `orbeon-war` target.
- Manually create the directory `orbeon-forms/src/resources-local` if it is missing.

This builds Orbeon Forms in development mode, where the Java/Scala class files are not placed into JARs. This way you can quickly recompile incrementally.

In this mode, running the `orbeon-war` ant target skips compilation but processes resources and creates an "exploded" WAR file which Tomcat can point to.

### Running Orbeon Forms

Create a new context in Tomcat's `server.xml`:

```xml
<Context
  path="/orbeon"
  docBase="/your/path/to/orbeon-forms/build/orbeon-war"
  reloadable="false"
  override="true"
  crossContext="true"
  allowLinking="true"/>
```

Then set `JAVA_OPTS` for Tomcat:

```bash
ORBEON_MEMORY_OPTS="-Xms300m -Xmx600m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -verbosegc -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails"
ORBEON_DEBUG_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=61155,suspend=n,server=y"
JAVA_OPTS="-ea $ORBEON_MEMORY_OPTS $ORBEON_DEBUG_OPTS -Dapple.awt.UIElement=true"
export JAVA_OPTS
```

Finally, you can start Tomcat with:

```bash
 ./apache-tomcat-7.0.53/bin/catalina.sh run
```

And test by going to:

http://localhost:8080/orbeon/

This will show the Orbeon Forms landing page.

Alternatively, for running without debugging:

```bash
JAVA_OPTS="$ORBEON_MEMORY_OPTS -server"
```

Alternatively, for running with the YourKit profiler, you need to set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/YourKit\ Java\ Profiler\ 12.0.6.app/bin/mac/
JAVA_OPTS="$ORBEON_MEMORY_OPTS -agentlib:yjpagent"
```
