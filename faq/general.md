### Is there any cost associated with using Orbeon Forms?

[Professional Edition (PE) builds](http://www.orbeon.com/download) are available through [PE Subscription plans](http://www.orbeon.com/pricing). Further commercial support is available with [Dev Support plans](http://www.orbeon.com/services).

[Community Edition (CE) builds](http://www.orbeon.com/download) are available free of charge whether your use it to build open source or commercial applications.

The complete [source code](github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/) to Orbeon Forms CE is available free of charge and under *real* open source terms. The source code to Orbeon Forms PE is available to subscription customers on demand.

With the open source code, you are free as you please to:

- extend the platform
- build applications on top of the platform

Note however that if you make changes to the existing Orbeon Forms code, you are bound by the terms of the LGPL license, which requires you to redistribute changes to the open source community when you distribute your application.

### Is Orbeon Forms an XForms Engine?

Orbeon Forms *includes* an XForms engine (also known as an XForms processor), which we refer to as the Orbeon Forms XForms engine.

But Orbeon Forms also includes:

- the Form Builder authoring tool
- the Form Runner runtime
- an XML pipeline engine running the XPL pipeline language
- an application controller (the Page Flow Controller or PFC)

You are free to use Orbeon Forms for its XForms functionality only, but you can also leverage more of Orbeon Forms to build your forms-based application.
