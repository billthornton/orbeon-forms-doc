### Is Orbeon Forms an XForms Engine?

Orbeon Forms *includes* an XForms engine (also known as an XForms processor), which we refer to as the Orbeon Forms XForms engine.

But Orbeon Forms also includes:

- the Form Builder authoring tool
- the Form Runner runtime
- an XML pipeline engine running the XPL pipeline language
- an application controller (the Page Flow Controller or PFC)

You are free to use Orbeon Forms for its XForms functionality only, but you can also leverage more of Orbeon Forms to build your forms-based application.
