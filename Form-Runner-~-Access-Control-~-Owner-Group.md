## Availability

See [[Database Support|Orbeon Forms Features ~ Database Support]].

## Usage

Owner/group-based are useful when you want users to only see their own data, or maybe also the data of other users in the same group. For Orbeon Forms to be able to show a user only her data, Orbeon Forms needs to know who that user is, and hence this can only be used for authenticated users.

To use this feature for a form, in Form Builder, when editing a form, open the *Permissions* dialog, and check boxes on the *Owner* and *Group member* lines as appropriate for your situation.
