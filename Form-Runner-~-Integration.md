## Integration points

Form Builder and Form Runner integrate with other systems through the following means:

- [[__Plain URLs__|Form Runner ~ Integration ~ URLs]]
    - Through URLS you access Form Runner and Form Builder's pages
    - The URLs can be accessed simply by using hyperlinks or redirects from other applications.
- __A [[configurable persistence API|Form Runner ~ APIs ~ Persistence]]__
    - The API is based on REST (that is, through HTTP).
    - It provides CRUD, search, and metadata operations.
    - see also [[Accessing data captured by forms|Form Runner ~ Accessing data captured by forms]]
_ __Other APIS__
    - [[Generate XML Schema|Form-Runner ~ APIs ~ Generate XML Schema]]
    - [[Duplicate form data|Form-Runner ~ APIs ~ Duplicate Form Data]]
    - [[List form data attachments|Form-Runner-~-APIs-~-List-Form-Data-Attachments]]
