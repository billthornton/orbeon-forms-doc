## Integration points  

Form Builder and Form Runner integrate with other systems through the following means:  

- plain URLs, through which you access Form Runner and Form Builder's pages
    - The URLs can be accessed simply by using hyperlinks or redirects from another application.
- a [configurable persistence API](http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/form-runner/persistence-api) based on REST (that is, through HTTP)
- HTTP services
  - called from forms via the Service Editors
  - called by Form Runner to load initial XML data
- [[embedding|Form-Runner ~ Embedding]] (including within a portal)

The persistence API can be implemented either within Orbeon Forms (like for example the built-in eXist persistence layer), or within an external system.  

### Form Runner URLs   

Form Runner and Form builder attempt to use friendly URLs.

The following URL patterns are followed:

* Summary page for a given form definition:  
    `/fr/[APPLICATION_NAME]/[FORM_NAME]/summary`
* New empty form data:  
    `/fr/[APPLICATION_NAME]/[FORM_NAME]/new`
* Edit existing form data:  
    `/fr/[APPLICATION_NAME]/[FORM_NAME]/edit/[DOCUMENT_ID]`
* Read-only HTML view:  
    `/fr/[APPLICATION_NAME]/[FORM_NAME]/view/[DOCUMENT_ID]`
* Read-only PDF view:  
    `/fr/[APPLICATION_NAME]/[FORM_NAME]/pdf/[DOCUMENT_ID]`

_NOTE: All paths above are relative to the deployment context, e.g the actual URLs start with http://localhost:8080/orbeon/fr/..._

### Persistence API

See [Persistence API](http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/form-runner/persistence-api).
