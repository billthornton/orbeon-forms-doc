## Form Builder URLs

Form Runner and Form builder attempt to use friendly URLs.

The following URL patterns are followed:

* Summary page:  
    `/fr/orbeon/builder/summary`
* New empty form definition:  
    `/fr/orbeon/builder/new`
* Edit existing form definition:  
    `/fr/orbeon/builder/edit/[FORM_ID]`

_NOTE: All paths above are relative to the deployment context, e.g the actual URLs start with http://localhost:8080/orbeon/fr/..._
