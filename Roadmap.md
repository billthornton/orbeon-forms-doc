## Ongoing development tracks

1. performance (e.g. memory use)
1. mobile (e.g. responsive UI)
1. architecture and maintenance (e.g. modularization)
1. integration (e.g. embedding, SQL Server support)
1. Form Builder modernization (e.g. drag-and-drop)

## What's in a release

For each release we would like to:

- have bug-fixes
- have at least one new feature (which can be small)
- book one day of work on [documentation tasks](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues?direction=desc&labels=Doc&milestone=&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)
- pick one maintenance (build system, refactoring, â€¦) item
- pick one performance item
- pick one mobile item if possible
- pick one 

The idea is, as some of those tasks are large, to do it incrementally when possible, so that some progress is made.

## Orbeon Forms 4.6

Focus:

- one performance item
    - suggested: [#1143](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1143)

    - suggested: 
- [4.6 issues](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues?direction=desc&milestone=37&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)

Dates:

- 2014-05-08: branching and big feature freeze
- 2014-06-05: tentative release date

## Orbeon Forms 4.7

Focus:

- TBD
- [Issues considered for 4.7 (in progress)](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues?direction=desc&milestone=38&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)

Dates:

*Counting 1 slower month.*

- 2014-08-xx: branching and big feature freeze
- 2014-09-xx: tentative release date

## Tracks

### Performance

- memory use (see umbrella [#1606](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1606))
- load time (see [#1239](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1239))

### Mobile

- responsive UI (see umbrella [#1181](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1181))

### Architecture and maintenance

Like any project, Orbeon Forms has some technical debt. It is not possible to remove all of it at once, but, like garbage collection, we would like to improve the code base incrementally.

In addition, we would like to look to the future to use the best possible languages and frameworks.

This includes:

- modularization of the code (see umbrella [#1585](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1585))
- evaluate Scala.js (see [#1600](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1600))
- drop old frameworks and adopt new ones

### Integration

- embedding ([#1235](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1235))
- SQL Server support ([#697](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/697))

### Form Builder modernization

- drag-and-drop ([#1479](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1479))
