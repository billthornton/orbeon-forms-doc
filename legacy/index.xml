                Welcome to the reference documentation for the Orbeon PresentationServer (OPS)
                platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                <!--Form-based web applications done the right way-->
                Orbeon PresentationServer is an <b>open source</b> platform that uses <b>standard
                XForms</b> to make your form-based web applications more <b>user-friendly</b> and
                <b>simpler to create</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike other web application frameworks based on Java objects or scripting
                languages, OPS is based on XML documents and XForms. This leads to an architecture
                perfectly suited for the tasks of capturing, processing, and presenting XML data,
                and does not require writing any Java or scripting code at all to implement a
                dynamic presentation layer for your web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                OPS is built around a user-friendly Ajax-based XForms engine, which brings standard
                W3C XForms to mainstream browsers, and the <a href="reference-xpl-pipelines">XPL
                engine</a>, a mature, high-performance XML pipeline engine for processing XML data.

                        The PFC is the heart of your OPS application. It defines your application's
                        pages and how you navigate between them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        (XPL).</b></a> XPL allows you to implement lightweight processes that handle
                        XML data, without writing a single line of Java or other scripting language.
                    </p>

                        provide services such as accessing databases, performing data
                        transformations, calling web services, and more. If you need more, you can
                        write your own XML components.

                This guide should be accessible to anyone with some experience developing simple web
                applications, but it is helpful to understand the basics of XML, Extensible
                Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), and XForms beforehand. For more
                information, consult the following sources as a starting point:
