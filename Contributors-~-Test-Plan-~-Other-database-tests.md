# DB2 DDL

Do the following just with DB2; there is no need to test this with Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server as this is done by the unit tests. Between tests, run the `drop table` statements below.

1. Run the [4.3 DDL] and [4.3 to 4.4 DDL].
2. Run the [4.4 DDL] and [4.4 to 4.6 DDL].
3. Run the [4.6 DDL].

```sql
drop table orbeon_form_definition ;
drop table orbeon_form_definition_attach ;
drop table orbeon_form_data ;
drop table orbeon_form_data_attach ;
```

# Oracle Flat View

- Enable the flat view option, adding:

    ```xml
    <property as="xs:boolean" name="oxf.fr.persistence.oracle.create-flat-view" value="true"/>
    ```
- Create  a form with the sections and controls named as in the table in the [flat view documentation], publish, check that a view with the appropriate column names is created.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM orbeon_f_a_a ;
    ```
