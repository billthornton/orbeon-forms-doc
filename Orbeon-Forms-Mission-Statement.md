## Vision

Orbeon Forms is about providing end users and form creators with _better web forms_.

- For users, forms produced by Orbeon Forms must be the best web forms you can imagine.
- For form creators, Orbeon Forms must be the most productive solution.

The implementation of this vision is a work in progress: while we hope that Orbeon Forms does well already, we are working at making it even better in the future.

## What does "better" mean?

- For end users, forms:
    - are usable. After all, nobody actually *likes* to fill-out forms!
    - don't frustrate users (for example by losing information).
    - are feature-rich. When needed, special controls help you enter data such as email addresses, form numbers, and more.
    - are accessible.
    - just work in your web browser, not through third-party plugins or applications.
- For developers:
    - Better L&F out of the box.
    - More declarativeigh-level description of forms: validation, relevance, repeats, etc.
    - Forms are built out of ready-made building blocks and components.
    - Form Runner helps you with persistence, i18n, PDF, print view, error summary, etc.
- For experts:
    - Forms are quicker to build with Form Builder.
    - No software to install on your own computer.
    - Reduce the need to involve developers.
    - Let developers do what they know best.
    - Forms are easier to maintain.
