## Introduction

There are three distinct categories of languages to consider:

1. The languages of the forms you create.
2. The languages of the Form Builder user interface.
3. The languages of the Form Runner user interface.

This means that a form author could use Form Builder in the French language, create a form in Mandarin Chinese, and run it with the Form Runner's English user interface.

## Form languages

Form Builder (Orbeon Forms PE only) lets you create forms in multiple languages. Most world languages are available, with some limitations described below.

### Known limitations

1. PDF output: There are some  known issues with ligatures in some Indian languages such as Hindi or Tamil.
2. Right-to-left languages are not officially supported.

We are glad to get help to address these two limitations.

## Form Builder and Form Runner user interface

- F: full support
- P: partial support
- N: no support

See also [[Localizing Orbeon Forms|Contributors-~-Localizing-Orbeon-Forms]] for information about how to localize Form Builder and Form runner in additional languages. Your contributions are welcome!

1. In 4.8, a few resources related to the new "singleton form" feature are missing.

*NOTE: In 4.6.0, Spanish, Italian and German have a few missing localized resources. In 4.6.2 PE, Italian and German resources are complete again. We hope to have Spanish resources fully updated for 4.9. Please let us know if you would like to help!*
