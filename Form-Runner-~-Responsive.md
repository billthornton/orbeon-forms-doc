Starting with version 4.10, Orbeon Forms supports [responsive design][1] for forms you create with Form Builder. One significant implication is that when your forms are shown on a narrow screen, for instance on a mobile phone, fields are reflowed to show on the same "column", whereas some will shown next to each other on a wider display.

For instance, where on a desktop or tablet fields show as:

![Fields as shown on a desktop](images/fr-responsive-desktop.png)

On a mobile phone, they will show as:

<p align="center"><img src="images/fr-responsive-mobile.png" width="50%"></p>
