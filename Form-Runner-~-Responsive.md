## Fields in one column

Starting with version 4.10, Orbeon Forms supports [responsive design][1] for forms you create with Form Builder. One significant implication is that when your forms are shown on a narrow screen, for instance on a mobile phone, fields are reflowed to show on the same "column", whereas some will shown next to each other on a wider display.

## Example

If you have a form with a section containing a grid with two columns, on a desktop or tablet your form might show as:

![Fields as shown on a desktop](images/fr-responsive-desktop.png)

When the same form is loaded from a mobile phone, fields will automatically be shown in one column to better fit that screen:

<p align="center"><img src="images/fr-responsive-mobile.png" width="40%"></p>
