## Introduction

Form Builder and Form Runner can produce PDF output in two ways:

- __Automatic__
    - The PDF is produced based on the appearance of the form in your web browser. This is similar to printing a read-only version of your form.
    - As a form author, you do not need to take any action to enable this mode.
- __Template-based__
    - You upload a PDF file using the Upload PDF dialog in the toolbox. At runtime, Form Runner fills-out Acrobat fields in the template.
    - This mode is automatically enabled for a form if a PDF template is attached.
    - For more, see [[PDF Templates|Form Builder ~ PDF Production ~ PDF Templates]].

## Availability

- Automatic PDF generation is available in Orbeon Forms CE and PE
- Templates are an [Orbeon Forms PE](http://www.orbeon.com/download) feature.
