# Wizard Component

<!-- toc -->

## What it does

The `fr:wizard` component presents the nested list of `fr:section` elements as a series of navigable steps. Only one section is visible at a time.

The component shows a table of contents and navigation.

## Basic usage

```xml
<fr:wizard>
    <fr:section id="personal-data-section">
        ...
    </fr:section>
    <fr:section id="comments-section">
        ...
    </fr:section>
</fr:wizard>
```

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 4.8]

The `sectionref` attribute allows reading and writing the current section *name* to instance data.

```xml
<fr:wizard sectionref="instance('foo')/bar">
    <fr:section id="personal-data-section">
        ...
```

When the wizard shows for the first time, the current section value is read from instance data. If it matches one of the section names, the given section is shown first. When the user navigates between sections, the current section name is stored into instance data.

*NOTE: The section name is obtained from the section id by removing its `-section` or `-control` suffix. So in this example, the value stored will be `personal-data` or `comments`*
