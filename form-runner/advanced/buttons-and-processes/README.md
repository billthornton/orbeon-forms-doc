# Buttons and processes

<!-- toc -->

## Availability

This feature is available with Orbeon Forms 4.2 and newer.

## Introduction

This documentation describes how to configure the behavior of the buttons that appear at the bottom of the Form Runner detail page, whether in `new`, `edit` or `view` mode. Here is an example of such buttons:

![Example of Form Runner buttons](../w9-form-buttons.png)

## What is a process?

A "process" consists in a list of actions, or steps, which are executed by Form Runner, typically when the user presses a button. For example, a process might say: "when the user presses this button, validate the form data, then save it to the database".

With Orbeon Forms, processes are configurable. They are defined separately from buttons, but can be linked to buttons. Orbeon Forms comes with predefined processes for some common tasks, such as saving form data, but you can write your own processes.

You can learn more about the [process syntax](syntax.md).

## Associating a process with a button

A process is automatically associated with a button by name when using the following properties:

- `oxf.fr.detail.buttons`
- `oxf.fr.detail.buttons.inner`
- `oxf.fr.detail.buttons.view`

For example:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:string"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.buttons.orbeon.controls"
  value="refresh summary clear pdf save-final wizard-prev wizard-next review"/>
```

Here the following buttons get associated with processes of the same name defined in separate properties:

- `refresh`
- `summary`
- `save-final`
- `wizard-prev`
- `wizard-next`
- `review`

*NOTE: As of Orbeon Forms 4.2, the `clear` and `pdf` buttons are not implemented as processes but handled directly by Form Runner.*

## Customizing processes

So how do you customize processes? Say you want to specify a couple of buttons on your "acme/hr" form. Like before, you define a property:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:string"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.buttons.acme.hr"
  value="save-draft send"/>
```

This places a `save-draft` and `send` buttons on the page. Their default labels are "Save" and "Send". Each button is
automatically associated with processes of the same names, `save-draft` and `send`. These particular buttons and
process names are standard, but we can customize them specifically for our form. Again, this is done with a property:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:string"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.process.send.acme.hr"
  value='require-valid
         then email
         then send("http://example.org/")
         then navigate("/success")
         recover navigate("/failure")'/>
```

Button labels can be overridden as well, as was the case before:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:string"
  name="oxf.fr.resource.*.*.en.buttons.send"
  value="Fancy Send"/>
```

*NOTE: With Orbeon Forms 4.5.x and earlier, the property must be `oxf.fr.resource.*.*.en.detail.buttons.send`. With Orbeon Forms 4.6 and newer, the `detail` token can and should be omitted.*

All the configuration above for a button called `send` could have been done with an entirely custom button named `foo`.

## Compatibility notes

### Starting with Orbeon Forms 4.2

#### Related Orbeon Forms 4.1 and earlier functionality

Up to version 4.1, Orbeon Forms had a few predefined buttons to specify what happens with form data:

- The "Save" button to save data to the database.
- The "Submit" button to save data and show a dialog after saving (with options to clear data, keep data, navigate to another page, or close the window).
- The "Send" (AKA "workflow-send") button to save data and then allow:
    - sending an email
    - sending form data to a service
    - redirecting the user to a success or error page

For more information, see [[Configuration Properties - Form Runner|Form-Runner-~-Configuration-properties]].

#### Deprecated buttons

The following buttons are deprecated:

- `save`: use `save-draft` or `save-final`
- `submit`: use the `send` button with the desired sequence of actions
- `workflow-send`: use the `send` button with the desired sequence of actions
- `workflow-review`: use `review` instead
- `workflow-edit`: use `edit` instead

When the `workflow-send` is used, the behavior matches that of Orbeon Forms 4.1 and earlier. The following properties
are considered to build a process:

- `oxf.fr.detail.send.email`
- `oxf.fr.detail.send.success.uri`
- `oxf.fr.detail.send.error.uri`

#### Removed property

The following property is no longer supported:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:boolean"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.send.pdf.*.*"
  value="false"/>
```

Instead, use:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:string"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.send.success.content.*.*"
  value="pdf-url"/>
```

### Starting with Orbeon Forms 4.3

#### The validate action no longer supports a property

The `validate` action no longer supports a `property` parameter. In particular, this means that the following property is no longer supported:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:boolean"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.save.validate.*.*"
  value="true"/>
```

This also means that the `maybe-require-valid` process is no longer available.

Instead, use the `save-draft` process, or customize a process with the `save` action but no `require-valid`.
