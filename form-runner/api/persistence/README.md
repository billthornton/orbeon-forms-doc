## Introduction

Orbeon Forms *form definitions* and *form data* are stored via an an abstraction called the persistence API. This allows storing form definitions and form data for all or specific forms in different places. For example, you could store your form definitions into Oracle, and your form data into your own, custom database.

## Built-in support

Out of the box, Orbeon Forms provides an implementation of the persistence API for a number of databases, and other implementations are provided by third parties. See [[Database Support|Orbeon Forms Features ~ Database Support]] for details.

## Configuration

For a description of the terminology and configuration properties, see [[Form Runner Configuration Properties|Form Runner ~ Configuration Properties]].
