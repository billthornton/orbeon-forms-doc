## Overview

Database services allow you to use data stored in a relational database, in your own table, for instance to dynamically populate a dropdown or other selection control, or to pre-populate fields based on a value entered by users.

## Populating a dropdown

In what follows, we'll see how you can populate a *Department* dropdown in your form using values stored in an `departments` table of your relational database.

### 1. Connect with the database

Say you want to populate a *Department* dropdown in your form using values stored in an `departments` table of your relational database. You'll start doing this Form Builder's *Database Service Editor*. There, under *Datasource* you type the name of a datasource you setup in your application server. If you're using Tomcat, the simplest way of doing this is to edit Tomcat's `server.xml`, there a `<Context>` for Orbeon Forms if you don't have one already, and inside it add a `<Resource>` pointing to your database. On Tomcat, you also need put the database JDBC driver in Tomcat's `lib` directory.

### 2. Write the SQL query

Still in the *Database Service Editor*, you write the SQL query to run in the database. When that query runs, Orbeon Forms creates an XML document with the data returned by the query, and you'll be referring to parts of that document when linking the database service to a specific dropdown. In essence, root element is always `<response>`, it contains one nested `<row>` element per row, which contains one element per column, with the element name being derived from the column name, and underscores replaced by dashes. So values for the `dept_no` column end up in the `<dept-no>` element.

### 3. Link to the dropdown
