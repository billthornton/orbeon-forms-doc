## Overview

You can control access to specific form fields based on the user user's roles.

## Accessing roles

The [`$fr-roles`][1] XPath variable can be used in formulas controlling whether a field or section is visible or readonly. See the [Form Builder control validation dialog][2].

You can make a control non-visible to the current user by defining a _visibility_ expression that returns `false()`. If the control is visible, you can make it readonly to current user by defining a _readonly_ expression that returns `true()`.
