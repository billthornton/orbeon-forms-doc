    - test/save/publish
- insert components from library into acme/test-library
    - insert S1 and S2 twice, S3
    - add French language
    - check language changes in builder (be aware of [#690](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/690))
    - publish
        - check control visibility change
        - check language changes
        - check services load in both languages (same labels)
        - enter data, save, check that data loads back in all fields
        - test that repeated grid in section template shows ([#1370](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1370)) in the builder and nicely
        - check review, PDF
- make sure Clear works (see [#807](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/807), broken as of 4.0-4.10!)
- makes invalid controls in section template prevent saving
