# Test Plan

For each release of Orbeon Forms, we follow this test plan, which tests functionality in addition to the ~800 automatic unit tests which run with every build of Orbeon Forms. In the future, we want to [automate most of this](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/227).

## Persistence

###  Basic Persistence [4.10 DONE]

Do at least for eXist and DB2, as automated tests already test most of this, and the code running for DB2 is almost identical to the code running for other relational databases. But if possible do for the other relational databases as well.

- Setup: in `properties-local.xml`, add:
    ```xml
    <property
        as="xs:string"
        name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.exist.*.*"
        value="exist"/>
    <property
        as="xs:string"
        name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.db2.*.*"
        value="db2"/>
    <property
        as="xs:string"
        processor-name="oxf:page-flow"
        name="service-public-methods"
        value="GET HEAD"/>
    ```
- Create forms: same form in all apps: `exist/a`, `db2/a`
    - add static image
    - use Duplicate button in FB Summary
    - then change app name
- Pages
    - FB: create form, publish
    - FR: check it shows on http://localhost:8080/orbeon/fr/
    - FR: create new form, review, back to edit ([#1643](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1643))
    - FR: enter data, save
    - FR: check it shows in the summary page
- Attachments
    - FB: attach static image to form
    - FB: add file attachment field
    - FB: save and publish
        - DB2: be aware of [#1409](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1409)
    - FR: deployed form loads image
    - FR: attach file, save, edit
- Search
    - FB: check summary/search field, save and deploy
    - FR: create new form data, see in summary
    - FR: search free-text and structured
    - FR: delete data in summary page works
- Duplicate
    - FR: Summary: Duplicate button works
        - data for latest form
        - older data
- Home page, with all persistence layers active
    - go to /fr/
    - check that form definitions from all persistence layers show

### Versioning

- Setup
    - Database: try with db2 at least.
    - Properties
        ```xml
        <property
            as="xs:boolean"
            name="oxf.fr.email.attach-pdf.db2.versioning"
            value="true"/>
        
        <property
            as="xs:boolean"
            name="oxf.fr.email.attach-tiff.db2.versioning"
            value="true"/>
        
        <property as="xs:string" name="oxf.fr.detail.buttons.db2.versioning">
            pdf tiff email save send
        </property>
        
        <property as="xs:string" name="oxf.fr.detail.process.send.db2.versioning">
            send(
                uri     = '/fr/service/custom/orbeon/echo', 
                replace = 'all', 
                content = 'pdf-url'
            )
        </property>
        
        <property
            as="xs:string"
            name="oxf.fr.email.to.db2.versioning"
            value=""/>
        ```

        Also have other email properties setup.

    - for container auth
        - in `web.xml`
            - uncomment security section towards the end
            - change first `<url-pattern>` from `/fr/*` to `/auth` (it doesn't matter that page doesn't exist, it's just a path to force authentication)
        - in `tomcat-users.xml`, setup users:
            - `<user username="clerk" password="clerk" roles="orbeon-user,clerk"/>`
            - `<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="orbeon-user,admin"/>`

        - save and publish
        - enable permissions for form and configure like on [doc page](../../form-runner/access-control/deployed-forms.md#example)
    - make sure permissions are followed
        - anonymous user
            - home page: link goes to new page (not summary)
            - summary page: unauthorized (fixed regression with [#1201](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1201))
            - detail page: only `new` accepted, `edit`, `view`, `pdf` are unauthorized

                - summary page
                    - sees data previously entered by anonymous user, cannot delete
                    - click on existing data created by anonymous user shows read-only view
                    - replace `view` with `edit` in URL shows 404
                    - PDF works
                    - click on new button opens new page
                - new/edit
                    - save data works
                    - user is owner so can edit his own data
                    - cannot delete from Summary because no `delete` permission
            - check permissions as admin/admin

                    - delete button enabled and works
                    - on open data, can edit data

### Autosave and Permissions Test [4.10 DONE]

Repeat what follows with Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, DB2 with the following settings:

*NOTE: As of Orbeon Forms 4.10, autosave is not supported with eXist.*

```xml
<property
    as="xs:string"
    name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.oracle.*.*"
    value="oracle"/>
<property
    as="xs:string"
    name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.mysql.*.*"
    value="mysql"/>
<property
    as="xs:string"
    name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.postgresql.*.*"
    value="postgresql"/>
<property
    as="xs:string"
    name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.sqlserver.*.*"
    value="sqlserver"/>
<property
    as="xs:string"
    name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.db2.*.*"
    value="db2"/>
<property 
    as="xs:string"  
    name="oxf.fr.authentication.container.roles" 
    value="a b"/>
<property 
    as="xs:string"  
    name="oxf.http.proxy.host"                   
    value="localhost"/>
<property 
    as="xs:integer" 
    name="oxf.http.proxy.port"                   
    value="8888"/>
```

Setup permissions e.g. in `tomcat-users.xml`:

```xml
<user username="a1" password="a1" roles="a"/>
<user username="a2" password="a2" roles="a"/>
<user username="b1" password="b1" roles="b"/>
```

Authorize on:

    http://localhost:8080/47pe/auth

- Autosave with permissions
    1. In FB, create form `$provider/autosave`.
        - Create a field *first name*, marked as shown on summary page.
        - Enable permissions as shown below, save, deploy.  
            ![Permissions dialog](images/test-permissions.png)
        - duplicate for all providers and publish
    2. Logged in as user `b1` in group `b`:
        - `$provider/autosave/new`, type *Ned*, save, change to *Ned2*, tab out, after 6s go to the summary page, check it shows *Ned2* as draft
    3. Logged in as user `a1` in group `a`:
        - Can see data of other users, but in readonly mode (since everyone can read)
            - Load `$provider/autosave/summary`
            - Check *Ned* shows, but has the readonly "label"
            - Check *Ned2* shows, but has the readonly "label"
            - Check that clicking on *Ned* and *Ned2* brings up the data in readonly mode
            - Edit the URL to have `edit` instead of `view`, check a 403 is returned
        - Drafts for saved
            - Load `$provider/autosave/new`
                - Check we don't get a prompt to edit the draft created by b1 (since we only have read access to it).
                - Type *Homer*, hit save, edit into *Homer2*, after 6s go to summary page, check it shows *Homer* and *Homer2* as draft
            - `$provider/autosave/summary`, click on *Homer2*, check the draft comes up
            - `$provider/autosave/summary`, click on *Homer*, check prompt comes up, try both options and see that *Homer*/*Homer2* comes up
            - editing one of the form data (*Homer* or *Homer2*), hit save, back on the summary check the draft was removed
        - Drafts for new
            - `$provider/autosave/new`, type *Bart*, after 6s go to summary page, check it shows *Bart* as draft
            - `$provider/autosave/new`, check prompt, and try both options
            - `$provider/autosave/new`, on prompt start from scratch, type *Lisa*, after 6s go to summary, check it shows *Bart* and *Lisa* as draft
            - `$provider/autosave/new`, check prompt, try both options, in particular the one showing the drafts for new
        - Summary
            - Edit *Homer*, change to *Homer4*, after 6s go back to summary page.
            - Delete *Homer*, check *Homer4* is deleted as well
            - Check *Lisa*, then view, check in view mode without prompt
            - Delete *Bart*, check *Lisa* not deleted
    4. With anonymous user:
        - `$provider/autosave/summary` only shows saved data, not drafts
        - change form definition to remove the read permission form anyone
        - `$provider/autosave/summary` returns 403 (since anonymous users don't have the read permission)
        - `$provider/autosave/new`, type *Homer*, tab out, after 6s check that no autosave was done (e.g. with Charles that no PUT was made to the persistence layer)
    5. Permissions of drafts in summary page
        - Log in as user `a1` in group `a`.
        - `$provider/autosave/summary`, delete everything (to clean things up).
        - As user `a1` in group `a`, go to `$provider/autosave/new`, type *Homer*, hit save, edit into *Homer2*, after 6s go to `$provider/autosave/summary`, check it shows *Homer* and *Homer2* as draft.
        - As user `a2` in group `a`, go to `$provider/autosave/summary`, check it shows *Homer* and *Homer2* as draft.
        - As user `b1` in group `b`, go to `$provider/autosave/summary`, check it shows neither *Homer* nor *Homer2*.

- Autosave without permissions (tests for [#1858](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1858))

    1. Go to /new again
    1. Dialog must propose loading draft
    1. Save
    1. Make change to text in field, tab out, wait for autosave
    1. Go back to /edit
    1. Dialog must propose loading draft

### DB2 DDL [4.10 DONE]

Do the following just with DB2; there is no need to test this with Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server as this is done by the unit tests. Before each test, run the `drop table` statements below.

1. Run the [4.3 DDL](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/blob/master/src/resources/apps/fr/persistence/relational/ddl/db2-4_3.sql) and [4.3 to 4.4 DDL](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/blob/master/src/resources/apps/fr/persistence/relational/ddl/db2-4_3-to-4_4.sql).
2. Run the [4.4 DDL](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/blob/master/src/resources/apps/fr/persistence/relational/ddl/db2-4_4.sql
) and [4.4 to 4.6 DDL](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/blob/master/src/resources/apps/fr/persistence/relational/ddl/db2-4_4-to-4_6.sql).
3. Run the [4.6 DDL](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/blob/master/src/resources/apps/fr/persistence/relational/ddl/db2-4_6.sql).

```sql
drop table orbeon_form_definition ;
drop table orbeon_form_definition_attach ;
drop table orbeon_form_data ;
drop table orbeon_form_data_attach ;
```

### Oracle and DB2 Flat View [4.10 DONE]

        as="xs:boolean"
        name="oxf.fr.persistence.oracle.create-flat-view" 
        value="true"/>

    <property 
        as="xs:boolean"
        name="oxf.fr.persistence.db2.create-flat-view" 
        value="true"/>

    <property 
        as="xs:string"
        name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.oracle.*.*"
        value="oracle"/>

    <property 
        as="xs:string"
        name="oxf.fr.persistence.provider.db2.*.*"
        value="db2"/>
    ```
- Remove existing view if any: `drop view orbeon_f_db2_a ;`
- Create a new form from [this source](https://gist.github.com/avernet/ff343c6a5e6c3be077d2), which has the sections and controls named as in the table in the [[flat view documentation|Form-Runner-~-Persistence-~-Flat-View]]
  - rename app name to `oracle` or `db2` depending
  - publish, check that a view with the appropriate column names is created.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM orbeon_f_db2_a;
    ```

### XForms Retry [4.10 DONE]

1. Retry happens
    - edit `resources/apps/xforms-sandbox/samples/dispatch-delay.xhtml`
        - change sleep service to use `sleep?delay=10` (sleep 10 s)
        - add to model
        ```xml
        <xf:setvalue
            event="xforms-submit-done"
            ref="/instance/count"
            value=". + 1"/>
        ```
    - set the following properties
    
        ```xml
        <property
            as="xs:integer"
            name="oxf.xforms.delay-before-ajax-timeout"
            value="2000"/>
        <property
            as="xs:integer"
            name="oxf.xforms.retry.delay-increment"    
            value="2000"/>
        ```
    - open 
        - http://localhost:8080/orbeon/xforms-sandbox/sample/dispatch-delay
        - in Chrome, open the Dev Tools, go to the Network tab (or use HttpScoop or Charles)
        - hit the *Manual save* button
        - check after ~10 seconds that the Ajax response succeeds with 200 (retry will return with 503 until the 10 s have elapsed)
        - can also hit the *Start* button, and notice the number incrementing after ~10s
        - (the loading indicator doesn't show while a retry is not in progress, which is somewhat unintuitive, but we'll fix this as part of [#1114](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1114))
2. Request not reaching server
    - change back  sleep service to use `sleep?delay=5` (sleep 5 s)
    - set the following properties
    
        ```xml
        <property
            as="xs:integer"
            name="oxf.xforms.delay-before-ajax-timeout"
            value="30000"/>
        <property
            as="xs:integer"
            name="oxf.xforms.retry.delay-increment"
            value="0"/>
        <property
            as="xs:string"
            name="oxf.http.proxy.host"
            value="localhost"/>
        <property
            as="xs:integer"
            name="oxf.http.proxy.port"
            value="8888"/>
        ```
    - load page again
    - using Charles, go in Proxy / Breakpoints, enable breakpoints, and add:  
      ![](images/test-charles-request.png)
    - click on *Manual save*
    - the request is intercepted by Charles where you click on Abort, check that the client retries the request right away and that the request doesn't show in the server logs
    - finally click on *Execute*, and check the request runs on the server, and the response reaches the browser after 5 s
3. Response not reaching client
    - change back  sleep service to use `sleep?delay=5` (sleep 5 s)
    - in Charles, edit the breakpoint set above (see screenshot), and this time break on the response, i.e. uncheck the "request" checkbox and check the "response" checkbox
    - click on *Manual save*
      - check after 5 s the breakpoint is hit
      - Abort (make sure to abort Ajax response, not call to sleep service - no longer an issue with 4.7+)
      - check the request is made again right away by the browser and replayed right away by the server
      - *Execute*
      - check the response reaches the client
4. Unexpected HTML response
    - change back  sleep service to use `sleep?delay=5` (sleep 5 s)
    - edit the response to contain non-valid XML, and *Execute*
    - check the client re-executes the request
5. File upload
    - setup
        - enable breakpoint on response for `/49pe/xforms-server/upload`
        - enable throttling in Charles per the following configuration  
          ![](images/test-charles-throttling.png)
        - download [this image](http://placekitten.com/g/2000/2000) (~200 KB)
    - http://localhost:8080/49pe/xforms-upload/
    - select image, and upload start in the background
    - abort the response to the background upload
    - check it interrupts the download (we're not retrying uploads) and message says "There was an error during the upload."
