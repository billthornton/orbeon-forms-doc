# XBL library

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction

The XForms engine finds XBL bindings in the following ways:

1. Inline bindings, that is bindings under the form's `xh:head`, are always processed.
2. Bindings by name are searched in the Orbeon Forms resources.
3. Other bindings (such as bindings by attribute) are searched based on the `oxf.xforms.xbl.library` property.

## Inline bindings

You can place inline `xbl:xbl` elements within the `xh:head` element, at the same level as `xf:model` elements. For example:

```xml
<xh:html
        xmlns:xh="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:xf="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms"
        xmlns:xbl="http://www.w3.org/ns/xbl">
    <xh:head>
        <xf:model id="fr-form-model">
            ...
        </xf:model>
        <xbl:xbl ...>
            <xbl:binding ...>
                ...
            </xbl:binding>
            <xbl:binding ...>
                ...
            </xbl:binding>
        </xbl:xbl>
        <xbl:xbl ...>
            <xbl:binding ...>
                ...
            </xbl:binding>
        </xbl:xbl>
    </xh:head>
    <xh:body>
        ...
    </xh:body>
</xh:html>
```

## By name bindings 

Orbeon Forms allows for automatic inclusion of XBL bindings when matching by name only. This avoids including the XBL for those components in all the forms that use them. In addition, the bindings can be shared among forms, which saves memory and makes loading them faster.

Automatic inclusion works by defining a mapping between:

- the XML namespace in which your XBL components are
- and a name which indirectly points to a directory containing the XBL file

The mapping is done via properties starting with `oxf.xforms.xbl.mapping`, for example:

```xml
<property as="xs:string" name="oxf.xforms.xbl.mapping.acme">
    http://www.acme.com/xbl
</property>
```

With the property above:

1. Say element `<acme:button>` is found by the XForms engine, in your own `http://www.acme.com/xbl` namespace.
2. Orbeon Forms looks for a property with a name that starts with `oxf.xforms.xbl.mapping` and with a value equal to the namespace `http://www.acme.com/xbl`. In this case it finds the property `oxf.xforms.xbl.mapping.acme`.
3. The XForms engine extracts the part of the property name after `oxf.xforms.xbl.mapping`, in this case `acme`.
4. This is used to resolve the resource `oxf:/xbl/acme/button/button.xbl`.
    * The first part of the path is always `xbl`.
    * This is followed by the directory name found in step 3, here `acme`.
    * This is followed by a directory with the same name as the local name of your component, containing an XBL file also with the same name, here `button/button.xbl`.  
    * The resource, if found, is automatically included in the page for XBL processing.

By default, all the elements in the `http://orbeon.org/oxf/xml/form-runner` namespace (typically using the prefix `fr`) are handled this way, as a mapping is defined by default as follows:

```xml
<property as="xs:string"  name="oxf.xforms.xbl.mapping.orbeon">
    http://orbeon.org/oxf/xml/form-runner
</property>
```

For example:

- `<fr:number>` is loaded from `oxf:/xbl/orbeon/number/number.xbl`
- `<fr:section>` is loaded from `oxf:/xbl/orbeon/section/section.xbl`

etc.

Such bindings are checked for freshness every time a form is loaded. If a binding is out of date, it is reloaded and the form is recompiled.

## Other bindings

Bindings which are not inline and which are not by name only need to be explicitly listed so that the XForms engine is able to process them. You do this with the `oxf.xforms.xbl.library` property. By default,  as of Orbeon Forms 4.9, this property is empty as no built-in XBL component binds by attribute in that version:

```xml
<property as="xs:string" name="oxf.xforms.xbl.library">
</property>
```

XBL components with bindings by attribute can be added using the same format used by `oxf.xforms.resources.baseline`. Say, for example, that `fr:tinymce` adds a binding by attribute as follows:

```xml
element="fr|tinymce, xf|textarea[mediatype ~= 'text/html']"
```

Then the component must be added to the property as follows:

```xml
<property as="xs:string" name="oxf.xforms.xbl.library">
    fr:tinymce
</property>
```

The `fr` prefix must be in scope, and there must be a mapping (via `oxf.xforms.xbl.mapping`) for the URI associated with that prefix (this is the case by default for `fr` and `http://orbeon.org/oxf/xml/form-runner`). With this, `fr:tinymce` points to the XBL file `oxf:/xbl/orbeon/tinymce/tinymce.xbl`.

Component references are separated by whitespace:

```xml
<property as="xs:string" name="oxf.xforms.xbl.library">
    fr:tinymce acme:button
</property>
```
