### Prerequisites

To go through this tutorial, you don't need much: any reasonably modern computer on which you can install Java 6 or 7 should do. You should be comfortable with installing new software on your computer, including uncompressing zip or gzip archives. You will also have to edit XML files. If you are familiar with HTML, this should not be a problem.

You also need a reasonably recent web browser. We recommend one of the following browsers:

* Mozilla Firefox
* Safari 4 or greater
* Google Chrome
* Opera 10 or greater
* Internet Explorer 8 or greater

You will _not_ have to:

* Write any Java code or any scripting language code.
* Use a compiler or other complicated build tool.
* Install browser plugins or any other client-side software, besides your regular web browser!
