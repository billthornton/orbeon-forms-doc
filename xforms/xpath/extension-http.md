## xxf:get-portlet-mode()

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 4.2]

Return the portlet mode.

```ruby
xxf:get-portlet-mode() as xs:string
```

If running within a portlet context, return the portlet mode (e.g. `view`, `edit`), otherwise return the empty sequence.

*NOTE: This function only works with the full portlet. The proxy portlet is not supported.*

## xxf:get-request-attribute()

```ruby
xxf:get-request-attribute(
    $name         as xs:string,
    $content-type as xs:string?
) as item()?
```

The `xxf:get-request-attribute()` function returns the value of the given request attribute. The attribute may have been previously placed in the request through Java code, or using `xxf:set-request-attribute()`, for example.

The types of attribute objects supported are the same [types supported by the Scope generator][3], plus types stored with `xxf:set-request-attribute()`.

If present, the second parameter can specify the 'text/plain' content type. In that case, if a String object is retrieved, it is return as an xs:string instead of being parsed as XML.

```xml
<!-- Get the "document" attribute and use it to replace instance "my-instance" -->
<xf:insert
  ref="instance('my-instance')"
  origin="xxf:get-request-attribute('document')"/>
```

_NOTE: This function can only be called during page initialization, otherwise it will throw an error. We recommend you use it only within event handlers called as a result of processing `xforms-model-construct-done` or `xforms-ready`, or from the `xxf:default` MIP._


## xxf:get-request-header()

```ruby
xxf:get-request-header(
    $header-name as xs:string
) as xs:string*
```

The `xxf:get-request-header()` function returns the value(s) of the given request HTTP header.

```xml
<!-- Remember the User-Agent header -->
<xf:setvalue
  ref="user-agent"
  value="xxf:get-request-header('User-Agent')"/>
```

This function can be used even after page initialization, and can be used everywhere other XPath functions are supported.

_NOTE: With Orbeon Forms 3.8 and 3.9, this function can only be called during page initialization, otherwise it will throw an error. We recommend you use it only within event handlers called as a result of processing `xforms-model-construct-done` or `xforms-ready`, or from the `xxf:default` MIP._

## xxf:get-request-parameter()

```ruby
xxf:get-request-parameter(
    $parameter-name as xs:string
) as xs:string*
```

The `xxf:get-request-parameter()` function returns the value(s) of the given request parameter.

```xml
<!-- Remember the "columns" parameter -->
<xf:setvalue
  ref="columns"
  value="xxf:get-request-parameter('columns')"/>
```

This function can be used even after page initialization, and can be used everywhere other XPath functions are supported.

_NOTE: With Orbeon Forms 3.8 and 3.9, this function can only be called during page initialization, otherwise it will throw an error. We recommend you use it only within event handlers called as a result of processing `xforms-model-construct-done` or `xforms-ready`, or from the `xxf:default` MIP._

_NOTE: By default, most if not all servlet containers do not use the UTF-8 encoding but use ISO-8859-1 instead to decode__ URL parameters__. You can configure your servlet container to support UTF-8 instead. See the following resources:_

## xxf:get-request-path()

```ruby
xxf:get-request-path() as xs:string
```

The `xxf:get-request-path()` function returns the path of the incoming HTTP request (without the Java servlet context if any).

```xml
<xf:setvalue
  ref="request-path"
  value="xxf:get-request-path()"/>
```

This function can be used even after page initialization, and can be used everywhere other XPath functions are supported.

_NOTE: With Orbeon Forms 3.8 and 3.9, this function can only be called during page initialization, otherwise it will throw an error. We recommend you use it only within event handlers called as a result of processing `xforms-model-construct-done` or `xforms-ready`, or from the `xxf:default` MIP._

## xxf:get-session-attribute()

```ruby
xxf:get-session-attribute(
    $name         as xs:string,
    $content-type as xs:string?
) as item()?
```

The `xxf:get-session-attribute()` function returns the value of the given session attribute.

The types of attribute objects supported are the same [types supported by the Scope generator][3], plus types stored with `xxf:set-session-attribute()`.

If present, the second parameter can specify the 'text/plain' content type. In that case, if a String object is retrieved, it is return as an xs:string instead of being parsed as XML.

```xml
<!-- Get the "document" attribute and use it to replace instance "my-instance" -->
<xf:insert
  ref="instance('my-instance')"
  origin="xxf:get-session-attribute('document')"/>
```

## xxf:set-request-attribute()

```ruby
xxf:set-request-attribute(
    $name  as xs:string,
    $value as item()
)
```

The `xxf:set-request-attribute()` function stores the given value as a request attribute.

```xml
<!-- Set the "document" attribute into the request -->
<xf:insert
  context="."
  origin="xxf:set-request-attribute('document', instance('my-instance'))"/>
```

## xxf:set-session-attribute()

```ruby
xxf:set-session-attribute(
    $name  as xs:string,
    $value as item()
)
```

The `xxf:set-session-attribute()` function stores the given value as a session attribute.

```xml
<!-- Set the "document" attribute into the session -->
<xf:insert

## xxf:user-roles()

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 4.9]

```ruby
xxf:user-roles() as xs:string*
```

Return the current user's groups if available. This function works with container- and header-driven methods. See [[Form Runner Access Control Setup|Form Runner ~ Access Control ~ Setup]].

## xxf:get-remote-user()

```ruby
xxf:get-remote-user() as xs:string?
```

Returns the username for the current user of the application, if known by the container, for instance because users log in with BASIC of FORM-based authentication.
