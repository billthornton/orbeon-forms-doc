## Categories of databases

We have two categories of databases:

- XML: eXist
- Relational: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, DB2

*NOTE: As of Orbeon Forms 4.4, the implementation of relational support is common to all databases. There used to be separate implementation for each relational database.*

## Third-party implementations

A third-party [MarkLogic persistence layer for Orbeon Form Runner](https://gitlab.dyomedea.com/marklogic/orbeon-form-runner-persistence-layer/tree/master) is available. As of 2015-03-02, this does not support versioning and owner/group-based permissions. Also please note that this is currently not officially supported by Orbeon.
