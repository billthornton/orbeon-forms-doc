# Custom error dialog

## Disabling the standard error dialog

By default, when an Ajax error happens, Orbeon Forms shows users an error dialog. First, you'll want to disable this behavior. You can do so by adding this property to your `properties-local.xml`:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:boolean"
    name="oxf.xforms.show-error-dialog"
    value="false">
```

## JavaScript event handler

Orbeon Forms exposes a [custom JavaScript event](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/#customevent): `ORBEON.xforms.Events.errorEvent`. You can register your own listener on that event, and when fired, send users to a page you choose, as done in the following snippet, which sends users to the Orbeon home page:

```javascript
ORBEON.xforms.Events.errorEvent.subscribe(function(eventName, eventData) {
    // your code here
});
```

## Example

In case the user session expires, or some other error happens, you would like to redirect them a page you created that will, for instance, tell users to log in and try again, and if the problem persists to contact customer support.

```javascript
ORBEON.xforms.Events.errorEvent.subscribe(function(eventName, eventData) {`  
    window.location.href = "http://www.example.org/";
});
```
