## Rationale

We describe a few usage scenarios for Orbeon Forms below, with the intent of answering the question "For what purpose can I use Orbeon Forms?".

## Forms for a local government

A local government publishes a number of forms for its citizens. Orbeon Forms is used for the capture of data as well as consultation by government employees.

- Citizens are provided with a catalog of available forms (e.g. linked from a web page).
- They can fill-out and submit relevant forms.
- The data is saved to a database and/or sent to other systems or workflows.
- The relevant government offices have access to the captured data for further processing.
  - Data entered by the citizen can be viewed.
  - Additional data and notes can be provided by the government employee.

## Forms for an organization's internal use

Within an organization, employees capture, consult, and modify data.

- Depending on permissions, different users can:
  - enter data only
  - view their own data, or that of a group they belong to
  - view all the data
  - amend (edit) or delete data
- Data can be kept in the database, or submitted to internal web services.

## Anonymous data capture

An form is provided online and allows data to be captured anonymously. Your organization can then consult the data. An example of this is the [Orbeon Forms PE Trial License form](http://demo.orbeon.com/orbeon/fr/orbeon/register/new).
