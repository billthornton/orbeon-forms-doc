## Rationale

We describe a few usage scenarios for Orbeon Forms below, with the intent of answering the question "For what purpose can I use Orbeon Forms?".

## Forms for a local government

A local government publishes a number of forms for its constituents. Orbeon Forms is used for the capture of data as well as consultation by government employees.

- Constituents are provided with a catalog of available forms (e.g. linked from a web page).
    - They can fill-out and submit relevant forms.
    - The data is saved to a database and/or sent to other systems or workflows.
    - If enabled, they can download a PDF of the form, with the data they entered in the web form.
    - If a "plain old signature" is required, they can print the PDF, sign it, and send the printed copy.
- The relevant government offices have access to the captured data for further processing.
    - Data entered by the citizen can be viewed.
    - Additional data and notes can be provided by the government employee.
    - If they receive a signed copy of the printed form, the copy can contain a bar code, so the government can correlate the printed form with information in the database, and thus avoid having to re-enter the information in the form.

## Forms for an organization's internal use

Within an organization, employees capture, consult, and modify data.

- Depending on permissions, different users can:
  - enter data only
  - view their own data, or that of a group they belong to
  - view all the data
  - amend (edit) or delete data
- Data can be kept in the database, or submitted to internal web services.

## Anonymous data capture

An form is provided online and allows data to be captured anonymously. Your organization can then consult the data. An example of this is the [Orbeon Forms PE Trial License form](http://demo.orbeon.com/orbeon/fr/orbeon/register/new).
