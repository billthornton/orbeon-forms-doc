## How autosave works

When autosave is enabled, form data is automatically saved as *drafts* in the background as you interact with the form. You can access drafts from the Summary page. On the Edit page, you'll also be asked whether you'd like to continue your work from a draft when needed.

## Configuration

The following property specifies the delay, in ms, after which form data should be automatically saved:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:integer"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.autosave-delay.*.*"
  value="5000"/>
```

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 4.4] If the value is 0 or negative, autosaving is disabled.

The following property enables or disable autosave for a given persistence provider. This is because autosave requires support from the persistence provider.

```xml
<property
  as="xs:boolean"
  name="oxf.fr.persistence.*.autosave"
  value="false"/>
```

For example, as of Orbeon Forms 4.4, the `exist` provider does not support autosave yet. But the `oracle` provider does:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:boolean"
  name="oxf.fr.persistence.oracle.autosave"
  value="true"/>
```

By default, the `oracle`, `mysql` and `db2` providers support autosave.
