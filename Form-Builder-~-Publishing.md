## Introduction

The notion of _publishing_ is central to Form Builder/Form Runner.

* As a form author, you work on a form definition in a special space where the form can be modified, saved, and tested.
* Once the form definition is ready, you _publish it_ to Form Runner.
* After that moment:
    * the form becomes available by form users for data entry
    * Form Builder is no longer part of the equation
