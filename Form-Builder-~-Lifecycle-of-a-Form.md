## Overview

Deployment use cases for Form Builder and Form Runner can vary depending on configuration, but here is a typical life for a form:

* **Design time** — The form author
    * Initiates the creation of a new form definition from the Form Builder summary page
    * Edits the form definition from the Form Builder editor
    * Saves the form definition
    * Tests the form definition
    * Multiple edit/save/test cycles can take place
    * Publishes the form definition

* **Runtime** — The form user
    * Initiates the creation of new form data from the form's summary page
    * Enters data into the form
    * Reviews, saves, submits, or downloads form data

Form definitions, as well as form data, can also be searched and deleted.
