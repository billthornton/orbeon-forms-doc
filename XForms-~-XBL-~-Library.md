## Introduction

The XForms engine finds XBL bindings in the following ways:

1. Inline bindings, that is bindings under the form's `xh:head`, are always processed.
2. Bindings by name are searched in the Orbeon Forms resources.
3. Other bindings (such as bindings by attribute) are searched based on the `oxf.xforms.xbl.library` property.
