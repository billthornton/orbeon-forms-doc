## Availability

Orbeon Forms 4.0 PE (since 2012-09-14).

## What it does

This is a Form Runner service which generates an XML Schema 1.0 schema for a published form. The schema is specific for the app and form name selected.

- You access the service using the following URL: `/fr/[app]/[form]/schema`
- Section templates and repeats are supported.

This assumes that the data model of the form is standard XML data model as generated by Form Builder. Custom XML data models are not supported.

## Limitations

Not all form validations can be encoded in an XML Schema. For example, validations specified with the XForms `constraint` attribute are not present, as they are expressed with XPath an XML Schema 1.0 does not support XPath constraints.
